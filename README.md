The competition has come to an end. I wanted to take a moment to share how incredibly valuable this experience has been for me. I began my journey in the lower ≈30%, claiming the 4438th spot on the public leaderboard. I was fortunate to make 
progress and reach the top ≈16%, securing the 1036th position on the private leaderboard alongside a remarkable group of 6430
participants. I'm truly thankful to the organizers and the Kaggle community for their unwavering support and their generosity in 
sharing their wisdom and insights to uplift one another. Needless to say, I'm genuinely filled with <img src="https://cdn.rcimg.net/zheanders/3e6623f8/dac3a8ec2f7c7d79d492881d77a81948.gif?width=300" width=10%> and <img src="https://media1.giphy.com/media/LNftQOF2MgeBI8Gdfz/giphy.gif?cid=6c09b952yv4fcu2oh4zyw7he04s9zvrbtnnw2o4czkkthfta&ep=v1_stickers_related&rid=giphy.gif&ct=s" width=7%> for this incredible journey!
